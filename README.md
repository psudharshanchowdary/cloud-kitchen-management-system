## Technologies Used

### Languages
- **TypeScript (TS)**: For frontend development (e.g., `page.tsx` files in `dashboard`, `kitchen`, `menu`, `orders`).
- **JavaScript (JS)**: For routing and utilities (e.g., `route.js`, `db.js`, `utils.ts`).
- **SQL**: For database schema and queries (e.g., `schema.sql`).

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **Next.js**: For building the frontend (`next.config.mjs`, `package.json`).
- **React**: For UI components (inferred from Next.js usage).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (`tailwind.config.ts`).
- **Java (Spring Boot)**: For backend API (e.g., `GlobalExceptionHandler.java` in `src/main/java/com/cloudkitchen`).

### Database
- **MySQL**: For storing data like orders, inventory, and menu items (`schema.sql`).

### Tools
- **Git**: For version control.
- **npm**: For package management (`npm-lock.yaml`).
- **UI Libraries**: Custom components and hooks (`use-mobile.tsx`, `use-toast.ts`).
